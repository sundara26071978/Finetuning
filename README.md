# LLM Fine-Tuning 

Welcome to the LLM Fine-Tuning repository! This folder contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts designed to assist in the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to provide you with comprehensive tools and resources to experiment with different fine-tuning strategies, train custom models, and evaluate their performance.

## Contents

### Notebooks
- **`notebook/fine_tune_experiment.ipynb`**: This notebook serves as a playground for exploring various fine-tuning approaches. It includes experiments on different dataset configurations, learning rates, and evaluation metrics.
  
- **`notebook/model_evaluation.ipynb`**: A dedicated notebook for evaluating the performance of your fine-tuned models. You can compare multiple models using this tool.

### Scripts
- **`scripts/train_model.py`**: The main script for training your custom LLM. This script allows you to configure hyperparameters, select datasets, and launch the training process.
  
- **`scripts/evaluate_model.py`**: A utility script to evaluate the performance of a trained model using test data or predefined metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook installed
- GPU with sufficient VRAM recommended for efficient fine-tuning

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: A `requirements.txt` file is included in the repository.)

## Usage Guide

### Notebooks

#### 1. `notebook/fine_tune_experiment.ipynb`
- Open this notebook to experiment with different fine-tuning strategies.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook to load datasets, select models, and adjust hyperparameters for optimal results.

#### 2. `notebook/model_evaluation.ipynb`
- Use this notebook to evaluate multiple trained models.
- Input the paths to your model weights and test data to generate comprehensive evaluation reports.

### Scripts

#### 1. `scripts/train_model.py`
- **Configuration**: Modify the hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) in the configuration file (`config.json`).
- **Dataset Setup**: Ensure your training and validation datasets are correctly formatted and placed in the appropriate directories.
- **Training Launch**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/train_model.py --config config.json
  ```
  
#### 2. `scripts/evaluate_model.py`
- **Model Loading**: Input the path to your trained model weights.
- **Evaluation**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model_path path/to/model.h5 --test_data test_dataset.csv
  ```
